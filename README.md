# Network-Intrusion-Detection

Detecting network intrusion using various machine learning algorithms.
Monitor a network or system for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insider.
The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ‘bad connections’ (intrusion/attacks) and a ‘good (normal) connections’.
